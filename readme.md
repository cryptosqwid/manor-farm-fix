## The Manor Farm Fix

A Firefox Extension that removes that annoying flying bug from themanor.farm website.

### Mozilla Addon

Currently under verification by Mozilla. Please be patient.

### Install locally

- Download the code.
- In Firefox: Open the `about:debugging` page, click the `This Firefox` option, click the `Load Temporary Add-on` button, then select `manifest.json` the `manor-farm-fix/src/` extension's directory.

The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.
